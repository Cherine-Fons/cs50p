Harvard CS50P: Introduction to Python Programming
### Coursework Repository — Harvard CS50P (Python)

## Purpose

This repository documents my progress through Harvard's CS50P course on Python programming. Each week contains exercises, scripts, and reflections as I build proficiency in core programming concepts.

- `week1/`: Basic syntax, print statements, input/output
- `week2/`: Conditional logic, loops
- `week3/`: Functions, parameters
- (More folders to be added as I progress)

## Purpose

This repository serves as a record of my foundational training in Python, as part of a broader transition into algorithmic problem-solving, data modeling, and computational reasoning for finance, cryptography, and AI domains.

All code is written from scratch and will be regularly updated as I move through the course.
